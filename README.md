# English-to-Kreole-Translator-C++
The following project was done during year 1 where we had to translate 500 English sentences to Kreole Mauricien sentences
Then we had to do a mapping and store the count in a file
We had to use those mappings to test our translator
Unfortunately due to a restricted amount of data only some words were correctly translated
